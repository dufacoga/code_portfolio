# 🤝 Contributing

Thanks for taking a moment to contribute! Whether you're here to report a bug, suggest an idea, or submit code — it’s genuinely appreciated.

This portfolio was rebuilt using **React**, **CSS Modules**, and **GitHub API integration**, so the contribution process focuses on JavaScript, JSX components, and styling logic.

## 🎯 Code Style & Commit Guidelines

To keep things clean and consistent:

- Use meaningful commit messages. Start with a verb (e.g., `Fix`, `Add`, `Update`) and avoid ending with punctuation.
- Example: `Improve responsive layout for GitHub projects section`

React encourages component-based structure, so feel free to split logic into new `.jsx` or `.js` files if needed.
